  ##Description 
  <br>
  Hello! I’m a Data Enthusiast with a passion for uncovering insights from raw information and using them to drive decision-making and innovation. My journey into the world of data began at the University of Hong Kong, where I honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.
  What fuels my enthusiasm for data? It’s the thrill of diving deep into datasets, the challenge of transforming complex patterns into understandable insights, and the satisfaction of seeing those insights inform strategic decisions. I believe that in our data-driven world, the ability to interpret and utilize data is not just a skill, but a language that every industry should speak.
  Beyond my love for data, I’m an adventurer at heart. I’m always on the lookout for new challenges and learning opportunities, whether that’s mastering a new data visualization tool or exploring a new city. I believe that every experience, no matter how small, teaches us something valuable and shapes who we are.
